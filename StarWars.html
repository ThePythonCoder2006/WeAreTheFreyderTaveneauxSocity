                &nbsp;TRAFFICKING</h2>
            <p> All around the world 500 000 people
                get
                killed by weapon that no one knew about, that were not
                regulated</p>
            <p> Very few countries try (and fail) to
                regulate non registerd weapons. This is because they
                used
                the wrong method.</p>
            <p> They only added restriction to
                LEGAL firearms and never even imagined that this would
                only
                make the black market bigger and juicier for weapon
                sellers.</p>
            <p>It is henceforth needed to find new
                and
                better solutions and moreover to apply these
                solutions...
